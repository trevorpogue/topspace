;;; Commentary:

;; TopSpace lets you display a buffer's first line in the center of a window
;; instead of just at the top.
;; This is done by automatically drawing an upper margin/padding above line 1
;; as you recenter and scroll it down.

;; See https://github.com/trevorpogue/topspace for a GIF demo & documentation.

;; Features:

;; - Easier on the eyes: Recenter or scroll down top text to a more
;;   comfortable eye level for reading, especially when in full-screen
;;   or on a large monitor.

;; - Easy to use: No new keybindings are required, keep using all
;;   your previous scrolling & recentering commands, except now you
;;   can also scroll down the first line.  It also integrates
;;   seamlessly with `centered-cursor-mode' to keep the cursor
;;   centered all the way to the first line.

  "Recenter line 1 with scrollable upper margin/padding.

TopSpace lets you display a buffer's first line in the center of a window
instead of just at the top.
This is done by automatically drawing an upper margin/padding above line 1
as you recenter and scroll it down.

See https://github.com/trevorpogue/topspace for a GIF demo & documentation.

Features:

- Easier on the eyes: Recenter or scroll down top text to a more
  comfortable eye level for reading, especially when in full-screen
  or on a large monitor.

- Easy to use: No new keybindings are required, keep using all
  your previous scrolling & recentering commands, except now you
  can also scroll above the top lines.  It also integrates
  seamlessly with `centered-cursor-mode' to keep the cursor
  centered all the way to the top line.

Enabling/disabling:
When called interactively, toggle `topspace-mode'.

With prefix ARG, enable `topspace-mode' if
ARG is positive, otherwise disable it.

When called from Lisp, enable `topspace-mode' if
ARG is omitted, nil or positive.

If ARG is `toggle', toggle `topspace-mode'.
Otherwise behave as if called interactively."
